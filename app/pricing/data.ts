Every rate includes a private room, robe, shower access, fresh linens and herbal tea — there is no separate facility or service charge.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are there any hidden charges or taxes added at the counter?",
    a: "No. The rate you are quoted is the rate you pay. Applicable taxes are already included in every published price, tipping is entirely optional, and we never add a facility, towel or locker fee.",
  },
  {
    q: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    a: "We accept cash, all major credit and debit cards, and UPI. Corporate and group bookings can be invoiced with full GST documentation on request.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer packages or memberships?",
    a: "Yes. Our Wellness Membership is ₹11,900 for five 60-minute massages, valid six months, which saves roughly 15% against single-visit rates and includes free steam and sauna access plus priority weekend booking. Sessions are transferable to family members.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a discount for first-time visitors?",
    a: "Yes — 15% off any single treatment on your first ever visit. Just mention it when you book. It cannot be combined with the weekday morning rate or the membership price.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do couples packages cost more than two individual massages?",
    a: "The Couples Spa Suite is ₹7,500 for 120 minutes, which is comparable to two individual 90-minute sessions but adds a private suite, synchronised therapists, Banya access and an aromatherapy setup. We recommend booking 24 hours ahead as suites are limited.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to pay in advance to reserve a slot?",
    a: "No advance payment is required for standard bookings — you pay after your treatment. For couples suites and group bookings of six or more we ask for a small confirmation deposit, adjustable against your final bill.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is your cancellation policy?",
    a: "Cancel or reschedule any standard booking free of charge. For couples suites and group bookings, please give us at least four hours' notice so we can release the room and therapists to other guests.",
