      "Almost every booking we take from Aerocity has a flight attached to it. That shapes how we run the session: we confirm your hard deadline first, build the treatment backwards from it, and put you in a room within twenty minutes of arrival rather than parking you in a waiting lounge.",
      "It also shapes what we recommend. Long-haul bodies are dehydrated, stiff through the hips and shoulders, and running on the wrong time zone. A generic relaxation massage is pleasant but wasted on that. Our therapists work the specific pattern that eleven hours in a seat produces, and finish with a sequence that either wakes you up or puts you down, depending on which you need next.",
      "For the corporate side of Aerocity — the offices around Worldmark and the conference floors in the hotels — we run chair-massage sessions on site and group bookings with invoiced billing and full GST documentation. Most of that work happens in the gap between a morning session and an evening flight.",

          "What helps is targeted: firm work through the hips and lower back to undo the sitting, lighter drainage-style work on the legs, and a finish chosen for what you need next. Tell the therapist whether you are going to a meeting or to bed and the last fifteen minutes change completely — brisker and shorter to wake you up, slower and warmer to put you down.",

Anything beyond five hours and the [Banya with venik](/services/) becomes the better use of the gap, because the heat cycle does more for a flown-out body than another half-hour on the table.",

    },
    {
      q: "Do you pick up from Aerocity hotels?",
      a: "Yes — complimentary pickup and drop-off for bookings of 90 minutes or longer, from JW Marriott, Pullman, Andaz, Roseate House, Holiday Inn, Aloft and the Worldmark serviced apartments. Send us your hotel and room number on WhatsApp and we will schedule the car.",
    },
    {
      q: "How far is your spa from Aerocity exactly?",
      a: "About five minutes by road. We are on the Mahipalpur side of NH-8 at Defence Enclave, directly opposite the Aerocity hospitality district. Allow eight minutes if the flyover is congested.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you have a branch inside Aerocity itself?",
      a: "No. We run a single premises at Office No. 118, Defence Enclave, Mahipalpur, and serve Aerocity from there. Keeping one location is how we hold the same therapists, the same hygiene standard and the same rate card for every guest.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can my company be invoiced for a group booking?",
      a: "Yes. We handle corporate bookings with invoiced billing and full GST documentation, including on-site chair massage at Aerocity offices and conference venues. Group discounts start at six guests.",

      q: "I have a flight in three hours. Is that enough time?",
      a: "Comfortably. Tell us your boarding time when you book and we will build the session backwards from it — typically a 45 or 60 minute treatment, a shower, and you are back at your terminal with an hour to spare. We have never made a guest miss a gate.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you charge more for late-night appointments?",
      a: "No. There is no night surcharge and no distance charge. A 3 AM session costs exactly what the same session costs at 3 PM.",
